# Predictive-Analysis-of-Spatiotemporal-Data
Implementation of ARIMA model to a spatiotemporal dataset of the number of chickenpox cases in different states of Hungary.  
The code is written in Python.
To run the code follow these steps:
1. Download the code and the dataset CSV file onto your system in the same folder.
2. Download Python, python IDLE, PIP and all the libraries used in the code: Pandas, Matplotlib and Statsmodels.
3. Open the code in an editor ( I use VSCode), change the path of the file in line number 5, and replace it with the path where you have saved the dataset in your system.
4. RUN the code.
To see different results you can comment and uncomment different lines of the code.
